In order for the program to work, you need to have all of these updated files downloaded. This includes the images! For easy download, use the zip file.

I also may have copied something over wrong from Abel's curret versions because the login page brings up the main page and then the login page when it should probably
be the other way around, so that will have to be looked over.

Otherwise it all seems to work?
