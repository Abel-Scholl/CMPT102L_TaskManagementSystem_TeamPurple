##I changed the CurrentUser csv file to a text file. It ended up being easier, less code.
##I updated the Login, Main, Add, Settings pages
##All are connected and fully functional
##This version does NOT include messageboxes for Edit and Remove. 
##We could also add confirmation messages to the search function. I just thought of it and i already uploaded it and im tired now so we'll do it next time
